        <div class="w3-justify">
          <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;margin: auto;cursor: zoom-in;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/cbf6bbb78a1f3e5c667d6ea04710c18ccc460afd.jpg" width="420" height="315">
          <p><strong>Makkah Al Mukarramah!</strong> is a dream of every Muslim, as the holy city reflects distinctive Arab historical features.
              It is located in the west of Saudi Arabia, about 400 km from Madinah, and from the city of Taif about 75 km in the eastern direction, 72 km from the city of Jeddah
              and the Red Sea coast.</p>
            <h5> Places to visit in makkah </h5>
            <p> Makkah province has the most number of visitors from around the world, where they visit many landmarks of Mecca, including:</p>
            <h6>Masjid Al Haram (The Haram Mosque)</h6>
            <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;margin: auto;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="https://www.ootlah.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.Masjid-Al-Haram-The-Haram-Mosque.png">
            <p>The magnificent Grand Mosque was built in the seventh century. Surrounded by the Kaaba.
                As one of the Hajj and Umrah destinations, it welcomes millions of worshipers every year.
                The history of the oldest part in the modern form of the mosque dates back to the 16th century,
                and many expansions have been carried out; including several important religious landmarks, such as: the Shrine of Ibrahim, Bir Zamzam, Al-Safa, and Al-Marwa.</p>
            <h6>The Ka’bah</h6>
           <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;margin: auto;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="https://www.ootlah.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2.The-Kabah1.png">
            <p>The Kaaba is considered the holiest place in Mecca, whose name means the cube, and mediates the square of the Grand Mosque.
                It is the Qibla (direction of prayer) of the Muslims around the world, circumambulating those around it during Hajj or Umrah.
                The height of the Kaaba is about 15 meters.</p>
            <h6>Cave of Thor</h6>
<img style="-webkit-user-select: none;margin: auto;background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 90%);transition: background-color 300ms;" src="https://www.ootlah.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3.Cave-of-Thor.png">
            <p>Ghar “Jabal” Thur is located in Makkah on a small mountain with a height of about 761 meters.
                This cave has great religious importance for Muslims, as the Prophet and his companion Abu Bakr went into hiding for three days from the Quraysh. 
                While they emigrated to Madinah. Since then, the place has become a symbol of faith and hope.</p>
